## Hackforms (A hacky survey for researchers with zero plata)

Doing online surveys is expensive
(did you know that Survey Monleys asks for a yearly payment in order to randomize pages in a form?).
This script simply randomizes requests to a preset list of google forms. Easy and hacky way to
randomize pages in a form.

Google Sheets is able to randomize questions.

This allows for a somewhat randomized survey.
